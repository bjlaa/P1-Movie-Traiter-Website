# Movie Trailer Website

In this project I built the server-side code written in Python to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This data is then served to a web page using HTML and CSS allowing visitors to review these movies and watch the trailers.

In order to access it in your browser:
