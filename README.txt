This is a website that shows all of my favourite movies.

To access the website, firstly open a terminal window and change directory 
to this file (movies). 
Enter the command: python entertainment_center.py. The fresh_tomatoes.py 
file will dynamically generate the webpage. 
Open fresh_tomatoes.html in your favourite web browser. Click on the movie 
posters to see its trailer.

MODIFICATIONS:

	In fresh_tomatoes.py

- Header:  colour, font size and height of the banner,
- Layout: two columns instead of three (I modified the class col-lg-4 by col-lg-6),
- added the storyline and the actors to be displayed below the title.

	In media.py: created new property movie_actors in Movie().

	In center.py: added actors names.
